# Burgermaker
Project Title
This is a burger maker application that can add any burger of your choosing and then gives the option to devour
it and place it on its own list. This way you can keep track of the burgers you would like to eat some day and can
mark off the ones you do end up eating! JS, handlebars, controllers, database were all used in making
of this project
